# DiscreteControllers
The DiscreteControllers C++ library represents a powerful toolkit designed to facilitate the seamless implementation of IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) and FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters, enabling the creation of real-time discrete filters in C++ applications. This library equips developers with a comprehensive set of tools to design and integrate digital filters efficiently and effectively.

One of the primary features of the DiscreteControllers library is its provision of classes for IIR and FIR filters. These classes offer a wide array of functionalities to construct and apply filters in real time. Whether it's the need to eliminate noise, perform signal processing, or carry out various filtering operations, the library offers an intuitive and versatile interface for developers to create and customize their desired digital filters.

Moreover, the DiscreteControllers library extends its capabilities to encompass a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller class. This PID controller class is intelligently designed to utilize the functionalities of the IIR class within the library. Developers can leverage this integration to efficiently build PID controllers for regulating systems, with the added advantage of selecting from a range of discretization methods. Notably, this includes the option to employ methods like backward Euler discretization, empowering users to tailor their controllers based on specific system requirements.

The DiscreteControllers library simplifies the complexities of digital filtering and PID control within C++ applications. It serves as an invaluable resource for developers seeking to incorporate robust, efficient, and customizable real-time digital filtering and control systems into their projects. Whether in the realms of signal processing, system control, or similar fields, this library stands as a fundamental tool for implementing high-performance discrete controllers.
